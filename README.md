#  Machine Learning Algorithms (with scikit-learn)

This repository contains practical implementations of popular Machine Learning algorithms using Python and the `scikit-learn` library. It includes Jupyter Notebooks covering both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques, along with essential preprocessing, evaluation, and model selection tools.
